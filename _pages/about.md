Now I am a Ph.D. student at the Software Institute, Nanjing University, under the supervision of both Professor [Zhenyu Chen](https://software.nju.edu.cn/zychen/) and Associate Professor [Chunrong Fang](https://chunrong.github.io), with academic collaboration and guidance from Assistant Professor [Shiqing Ma](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shiqingma/) at  University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am also a joint Ph.D. student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (Nov. 2024 – expected: April 2026), under the supervision of Professor [Jinsong Dong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/), with academic collaboration and guidance from Professor [Jun Sun](https://sunjun.site//). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2021, advised by Prof. Xianping Guo.

My research focuses on building robust and trustworthy AI systems. More specifically, I aim to develop formal verification methods and security analysis techniques for deep learning models, with particular interest in neural network verification, watermark removal, and privacy-preserving generation.

I am actively looking for postdoctoral positions in trustworthy AI and security, and would be happy to connect for potential collaborations. Feel free to contact me via email: yuan.xiao [AT] smail.nju.edu.cn.
